"""Demonstrates various Python loop constructs and their applications.

This module showcases different types of loops in Python, including for loops,
while loops, and loop control statements (break and continue). It includes examples
of iterating over ranges and lists, generating a multiplication table, producing
a Fibonacci sequence, and using loop control to filter numbers.
